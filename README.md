- Attrition Analysis by Department: Sales and Human Resources have higher attrition rates compared to Research & Development.
- Salary Band Distribution: Most employees fall within the "Low" and "Medium" salary bands.
- Effect of Promotions: Employees who have not been promoted for many years tend to leave more frequently.
- Model Performance:
- Logistic Regression achieves 87% accuracy but struggles with recall for quitting employees.
- Decision Tree has slightly lower accuracy (81%) and does not generalize well.
- A neural network model is trained with high accuracy (100% on training data), but it may be overfitting.
Let me know if youâ€™d like any help interpreting specific parts of the analysis or refining the models further!
